# External SEO evidence register

Audit date: 7 September 2026

## Verified public DNS

The public nameservers are `dns1.bigrock.in` through `dns4.bigrock.in`; DNS changes require the authorized BigRock account.

| Control | Current public record | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SPF | `v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all` | Active |
| DMARC | `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:sales@indianinfotech.org` | Active in monitor mode |
| MX | `indianinfotech-org.mail.protection.outlook.com` | Microsoft 365 |
| Google domain verification | Google Search Console DNS verification token | Active |

Keep DMARC in monitor mode until aggregate reports confirm legitimate senders. Record the previous TXT value, TTL, owner, approval, and propagation result before changing any DNS entry.

## Canonical business record

## Site-side readiness

- GA4/GTM loads only when a valid environment ID is supplied.
- Meta Pixel loads only when a valid numeric `NEXT_PUBLIC_META_PIXEL_ID` is supplied.
- The Sites environment currently has no configured GA4, GTM, or Meta Pixel ID.
- The official LinkedIn profile is linked in the footer and Organization structured data.
- The private Sites deployment has no custom domain attached, so do not submit the preview URL to search engines or business directories.
