# Indian Infotech implementation audit

**Audit date:** 2 September 2026  
**Audited plans:** `INDIAN_INFOTECH_SEO_90_PLUS_PLAN.md` and `indian_infotech_website_transformation_report.md`  
**Source state:** validated changes are pushed to `github/main`.
**Current production URL:** https://indian-info-website-2.vercel.app

## Result

The code and deployed site fulfill the implementable technical SEO foundation and a substantial part of the transformation roadmap. The two plans are **not fully fulfilled** because several requirements depend on company-approved evidence, external accounts, live operational systems, and ongoing marketing work that are not present in the project.

## Fulfilled and verified

- Global and page-specific titles, descriptions, canonicals, Open Graph, X/Twitter cards, favicon, and web app manifest.
- Production indexing rules, preview/staging noindex controls, `robots.txt`, XML sitemap, and legacy redirects.
- Fourteen unique high-intent landing pages with introductions, capabilities, benefits, integrations, industries, FAQs, CTAs, and internal links.
- Product, software, HRMS, solution, industry, pharma, insight, company, contact, support, trust, partner, academy, developer, search, comparison, resource, procurement, and solution-builder routes.
- Organization, LocalBusiness, WebSite, Product, SoftwareApplication, Service, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList, and BlogPosting structured data where relevant.
- One H1 per sitemap page, semantic heading order, image alternative text, keyboard focus styles, form labels, skip navigation, responsive layouts, and reduced-motion rules.
- Search, product filtering, product comparison, per-product specification downloads, multi-module solution architecture and quote brief generator, printable tender guidance, and transparent ROI calculator.
- EasyTime Online and Canteen Management now expose brochure-sourced, configuration-qualified facts from the shared software catalogue; every software route also provides a generated specification-summary download.
- The Trust Center now exposes a typed evidence register with status and ownership, verified public-website security controls, responsible vulnerability-reporting guidance, and explicit boundaries around deployment-specific evidence.
- Case-study and testimonial evidence now have a source-backed intake workflow, printable guide, downloadable brief, metric-provenance requirements, channel-specific permission, approval ownership, and withdrawal-contact fields.
- Offscreen homepage chapters defer rendering work, hero image requests use panel-aware responsive sizes, skip navigation lands on a focusable target, decorative navigation roles were removed, and the fixed WhatsApp action respects mobile safe areas.
- Security headers, HTTPS upgrade behavior, CSP nonces, safe enquiry handling, and privacy-aware optional analytics.
- WebP derivatives for large live poster, company, and technology images. Affected files are approximately 34–155 KB instead of 1.2–1.9 MB PNG sources.
- Unsupported anonymous testimonial copy was removed; named outcomes, quotations, and metrics are now explicitly gated on evidence and display permission.
- Sitemap modification dates are emitted only for editorial content with a real publication date, avoiding artificial daily freshness signals.
- The source commit is pushed and the current Vercel URL responds, but its deployed revision has not yet picked up the new routes (the new `/compare`, `/testimonials`, `/trust/quality-policy`, and brochure URL currently return 404). A deployment-provider handoff is required before calling the new release live.
- Homepage statistics now come from one provenance-aware company profile, render their final values in initial HTML, and animate from zero when the stats enter view.
- `/compare` provides side-by-side selection for up to three products, including use-case fields, contact-for-pricing, and datasheet request routes.
- `/testimonials` and `/case-studies` are dedicated publication gates; unsupported anonymous quotes and unapproved outcomes are not rendered as proof.
- The supplied company brochure is available as a direct PDF resource. Unsupplied certificate, policy, customer, and product-download records remain explicitly pending instead of being fabricated.
- Industry detail pages include context-specific solution routes, recommended product starting points, specialist CTAs, and evidence-safe case-study slots.
- Redirects are defined once in `lib/legacy-routes.mjs`, executed as one-hop 301s, and checked by `npm run check:readiness`.
- `CUTOVER_RUNBOOK.md` records the DNS, SSL, MX-preservation, analytics, account-verification, rollback, and post-launch operator gates that code cannot complete on its own.

## Verification evidence

- `npm run check:seo`: passed.
- `npm run check:security`: passed.
- `npm run lint`: passed.
- `npm run build`: passed.
- `npm run build:vercel`: passed, including TypeScript and 106 generated pages.
- `npm run check:readiness`: passed, including 28 one-hop 301 redirect records, claim provenance, proof publication gates, PDF/resource artifacts, launch runbook, and responsive image-size checks.
- `npm run build:vercel`: passed via the validated Vinext build path; the environment's standalone Next 16 `--showConfig` parser is not usable here even though `npx tsc --noEmit` passes.
- Local production crawl: 104 sitemap pages, 120 internal links, 126 rendered images, and 277 JSON-LD blocks checked with zero errors. The public URL was separately checked for HTTP availability; its new-route 404s are recorded above.
- The rendered audit checks HTTP status, unique titles/descriptions/canonicals, social metadata, indexability, one H1, heading-level order, JSON-LD parsing, broken internal links, missing image alt attributes, broken rendered images, search noindex, 404 behavior, and production robots directives.

## Not fulfilled yet

### Production and measurement

- `indianinfotech.org` still serves the legacy WordPress website. The new site is correctly canonicalized to its current Vercel production domain until a custom-domain cutover is authorized.
- Google Search Console verification and GA4 conversion reporting are not active because their account values have not been supplied.
- Google PageSpeed Insights returned HTTP 429 during this audit. Lighthouse 90+/95+ scores and field Core Web Vitals are therefore not proven.
- The public status page was removed from navigation and sitemap until a real uptime monitor and incident workflow are connected; support remains the issue route.

### Evidence and operational content

- Ten approved case studies, deployment metrics, customer quotes, video testimonials, and customer-result cards have not been supplied.
- Approved manuals, datasheets, drivers, firmware, release notes, checksums, versions, and download archives have not been supplied.
- Current software screenshots, interactive EasyTime demo material, API endpoints, SDKs, sandbox credentials, and integration-specific technical documentation have not been supplied.
- A live uptime monitor, incident feed, support-ticket backend, SLA workflow, CRM form endpoint, partner portal, and academy course/certification system are not connected.
- Verified partner records, integration logos, security/compliance evidence, subprocessors, encryption details, and formal trust documents are not supplied.
- Google Business Profile work, backlinks, Search Console submission, keyword tracking, publishing cadence, videos, social publishing, and monthly governance are ongoing business operations rather than one-time repository changes.

## Inputs required to finish the remaining scope

1. Confirm the final production domain and authorize DNS/domain cutover.
2. Provide the Google Search Console verification token and GA4 measurement ID.
3. Supply approved customer evidence, downloads, product specifications, screenshots, APIs, integrations, security documents, training content, partner records, and service-monitor ownership.
4. Confirm the CRM/support/status providers and credentials to connect.
5. Run PageSpeed Insights and Search Console Core Web Vitals after the custom-domain deployment has collected real traffic data.
